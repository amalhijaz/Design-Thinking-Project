## PROJECT OVERVIEW
The project aimed to alleviate indoor navigation difficulties within Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, where the large size of campus buildings, numbers of floors, and similarity in corridor appearances continuously make students and visitors experience confusion, stress, and pressure. The conventional navigation approaches using signboards and static maps were ineffective, especially for complex indoor navigation. In response, we created a user-centered digital solution-the UTM Indoor Navigation System-to address this.

This project was implemented using the Design Thinking methodology, involving five major phases: Empathy, Define, Ideation, Prototype, and Testing. The Empathy phase involves us conducting surveys among UTM students, staff, and visitors on their experiences and challenges in navigating through the university. The data collected was then analyzed in the Define phase to identify core problems such as inability to tell which floor one is on, confusion from poor signage, and time wasted in navigating buildings. This idea generation was done during the Ideation phase to supplement with the selection of practical and useful solutions to the problems identified in the form of a Dynamic 3D Indoor Map mobile app, alongside other solutions of static 2D maps and QR code navigation, as well as AR navigation.

Then, based on this functional analysis, a non-functional prototype of the proposed system was developed to illustrate how users might select a building, specify their source and destination points, and navigate around using an indoor 3D map. Surveys for user feedback were conducted to test this prototype, and results indicated positive responses in terms of understandability, usability, and usefulness. Some suggestions for improvement, such as enhancing floor transition and accessibility features, were suggested by participants in the Testing stage, which helped us.

## REFLECTIONS
This project taught me about the Design Thinking methodology and how it can be employed to create useful solutions for users by following certain phases like empathy, define, ideation, prototype and testing phase. It helped me learn how to tackle problems in a better manner and become competent at designing systems without any presumptions regarding users.
